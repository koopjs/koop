All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Unreleased
### Fixed
* Parse comma delimited `orderByFields` parameter and trim any white space.

### Changed
* Show warnings when `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` AND `KOOP_WARNINGS !== 'suppress'`

## [1.16.3] - 07-30-2018
### Fixed
* Remove dependency on node-srs
* In `normalizeSR`, add WKT lookups for uncommon WKIDs so that valid WKIDs are not considered unknown and redefined
* In `normalizeSR`, add check for WGS_1984_Web_Mercator_Auxiliary_Sphere and return 3857 when found

## [1.16.2] - 07-11-2018
### Fixed
* Make farmhash an optional dependency due to its need for compilation, which some environments may not support

## [1.16.1] - 07-05-2018
### Fixed
* Ensure OBJECTID is omitted from query results when options specifically exclude it (e.g., `returnIdsOnly=true`)
* Moved `esriFy` function to SQL, which now allows ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET to also be applied via SQL.

## [1.16.0] - 06-29-2018
### Added
* Add normalization of a `option.sourceSR`; this option identifies the CRS of the source data and defaults to 'EPSG:4326'; 
* If `option.sourceSR` is defined and geometry filter is defined, the geometry filter is reprojected to the CRS of the source
* Use srs npm to validate WKT CRS
* Added additional polygon projection tests

## [1.15.3] - 06-04-2018
### Fixed
* Handle `inSR` options that arrive as objects

## [1.15.2] - 05-03-2018
### Added
* Warning when `idField` used for OBJECTID assignement is not an integer or is out-of-range.

## [1.15.1] - 05-02-2018
### Fixed
* assignment of OBJECTID had used the `idField` of a query result rather that the raw feature; thus, assignment could not occur unless the `idField` was returned by the SELECT. Alter to use raw feature's `idField`

## [1.15.0] - 04-20-2018
### Added
* support for `esriSpatialRelEnvelopeIntersects`

### Fixed
* coordinates not projected when latitude or longitude is 0

## [1.14.0] - 04-17-2018
### Fixed
* OBJECTID collisions when a provider's `idField` is unspecified.  Now creating a numeric hash for each raw feature

## [1.13.0] - 04-04-2018
### Added
* Add support for date comparisons in WHERE filter with timestamp Syntax and BETWEEN operator

### Fixed
* Exclusion of date fields from response when not requested with `outFields` option
* Attempted property access of null feature in `ST_Intersects` function

## [1.12.7] - 04-03-2018 
### Fixed
* Ensure geometry is omitted from query results when option `returnGeometry: false`

### Added
* RELEASE.md and linked to it from README.md
