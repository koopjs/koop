### a node.js implimentation of ArcGIS Server

### Note: This server is in active development and does not currently (and probably) never will attempt to impliment 100% of the GeoService Rest Spec

## Goal 

To provide a flexible server for exposing new/experimental data source and types as both Feature Services and other data formats. This server is meant to provide a simple platform to extend the currently supported functionality of ArcGIS Server, and act a means for benchmarking and showcasing new ideas around web mapping.
