* support for a NAD83 to WGS84 datum shift for UTM datasets

## [2.1.3] - 2015-04-21
### Changed
* applying a datum xform for proj codes 2927. We may need to apply this across all State Plane HARN based projections in the future.

## [2.1.2] - 2015-04-20
### Changed
* fixed an off by one issue in the new export paging strategy. This cropped in testing datasets with exactlye 5000 feature missing one feature. Basically we paged starting at `id === 0` instead of `id === 1`.
* using new body-parser methods to parse post bodies for app/json and app/form-urlencoded post bodies

## [2.1.1] - 2015-04-14
### Changed
* sending -update to ogr2ogr to support large file exports
* fixed the idFilter clause for normal, non-worker exports
* using the dataset hash key for VRT files to fix a bug with exports

* Using Lambert_Conformal_Conic_2SP instead of 1SP to correct projection errors using 1SP.


## [2.0.4] - 2015-04-06

### Changed
* Small data exports in worker mode now use the regular exportToFormat workflow in Exporter.js

## [2.0.1] - 2015-04-01
### Changed
* Forcing status processing on progress reporting from export worker jobs
* Wrapping projection WKT in single quotes for calls to ogr2ogr

## [2.0.0] - 2015-03-31
### Changed
* Replaced logic in `lib/Extent.js` with [esri-extent](https://github.com/ngoldman/esri-extent) ([#130](https://github.com/Esri/koop/issues/130)).
* Exporter does not include json partials in exported zipfiles

### Added

### Removed
* tile support is no longer included by default, please use [koop-tile-plugin](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-tile-plugin) if needed

## [1.1.2] - 2015-03-25 [DEPRECATED]

**This version has been deprecated due to a breaking change introduced in `v1.1.0`.**

### Added
* If a provider passes a WKID to the Exporter methods the data will be projected into that ESPG/WKID

### Changed
* First pass at a refactored Exporter. Still needs to be revisited but more code is now shared across the `exportToFormat` and `exportLarge` methods. Anything that can be shared is now shared, but the logic in the `exportLarge` method needs another pass.

## [1.1.1] - 2015-03-19 [DEPRECATED]

**This version has been deprecated due to a breaking change introduced in `v1.1.0`.**

### Added
* Log files will now rotate automatically

### Changed
* BaseModel will remove unneeded json data from geojson when passing to the tile plugin

## [1.1.0] - 2015-03-17 [DEPRECATED]

**Deprecated due to a breaking change: removed tiles/mapnik support**

Please use [koop-tile-plugin](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-tile-plugin) if you need tile support.

### Changed
* No more mapnik dependency by default. Instead all tile logic has been moved to the [koop-tile-plugin](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-tile-plugin) module.
* Also better checks for the tile plugin in the BaseModel

## [1.0.19] - 2015-03-04
### Changed
* We are now using the latest [node-mapnik](https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik) version, which should help with installs on Windows.

## [1.0.18] - 2015-03-02
### Added
- support for `koop-pgcache` to export workers

## [1.0.17] - 2015-03-02
### Changed
- Koop no longer ships with default support for PostGIS or SpatiaLite. These have become optional plugins.
  - this means they need to be added the koop module at server start up time
  - koop now ships with a `Local` cache out of the box that is not persisted across server sessions

## [1.0.16] - 2015-02-13
### Fixed
- Added missing `connect-multiparty` module to `package.json`

## [1.0.15] - 2015-02-12
### Added
- Added support for multipart form posts

### Changed
- Fixed the way feature service requests handle query strings to the info endpoints

## [1.0.14] - 2015-02-10
### Changed
- default routes needed to add support for POSTs to feature service endpoints
- worker exporters needed to exit more gracefully and stop working when a file fails to be created
- a typo in `GeoJSON.fromEsri` was crashing request pages in `koop-agol`

## [1.0.13] - 2015-02-02
### Changed
- changed the way tiles are created, rather than creating a file on disk, now we just pass the mapnik XML around
- using `ST_Simplify` instead of `ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology` for speed

## [1.0.12] - 2015-01-29
### Added
- Now sending expiration time with base JSON response (helps with cache life)

### Changed
- Set default tile style to points

## [1.0.11] - 2015-01-27
### Changed
- Fixed support for bad `outStatistics` params in the URL

## [1.0.10] - 2015-01-26
### Changed
- using mapnik-pool for all tiles now
- refactored tiles for better vector tile buffer/edge support in the mapnik
- PBF tiles are now deflated via zlib, which makes them smaller
  - providers need to set the header `content-encoding: deflate`

## [1.0.9] - 2015-01-21
### Changed
- splitting objectIds for feature service queries
  - must be a string, not an array now (as per the geoservices rest spec)

## [1.0.8] - 2015-01-21
### Changed
- fixed an issue with object id fields in feature service queries for Ids with filters
  - when using returnIdsOnly the objectID was not getting set, which return false rows.

## [1.0.7] - 2015-01-20
### Changed
- lib/Tiles.js now passes along an optional name param to the tile generator. Vector tile use this name to store features.
- fixed the tests, they are passing but jshint is not.
- changed the way the lib/BaseController.js sends back its statuses.

## [1.0.6] - 2015-01-16
### Added
- a flag to the lib/Exporter.js class that will lock export jobs to prevent duplicate jobs stepping on each other in the queue.
  - This means that one job per dataset can be enqueued at a time.
  - Down the road this may cause problems for when we want to pre-cache several formats for the same dataset at the same time. That bridge will be crossed at that time.

## [1.0.5] - 2015-01-15
### Added
- a flag to the lib/PostGIS.js cache too ignore the selection limit unless a provider wants to use it.
  - since this feature is used by only a couple providers it seemed better to make it an opt-in option for the few, rather than an opt-out option across every provider.

## [1.0.4] - 2015-01-15
### Added
- adding an ability to override koop's data limit of 2k.

## [1.0.3] - 2015-01-13
### Changed
- Fixed a bug in the ExportWorker where shps were being created as a directory with an extension .shp; this fixes some formatting errors that were related.

## [1.0.2] - 2015-01-13
### Changed
- Koop exports now force OGR to create shp file dirs instead of files; This adds more consistency so the code can maintain a single way for creating zip exports
- The query support for outStatistics now removes any passed in slashes so it stops choking on parsing semi-bad inputs
- The large data limit was moved from 10k features to 2k. This helps koop when its deployed with workers in that more work is handed down to the workers, which is good.


## [1.0.1] - 2015-01-08
### Added
- For providers where hosts are used the info in the cache now stores the ID of the host for that datasets
- New providers endpoints for accessing metadata about installed providers and all data in the cache per provider
- CSV files now get a BOM to help with parsing utf-8 chars in Excel
- Updated the docs in the readme to be a tad bit cleaner

## [1.0.0] - 2014-12-30
Koop is now just a node module that exposes an express middleware app with hooks to register koop providers. This pattern represents a cleaner way to structure using koop with a series of other modules and makes deploying to places like Heroku and AWS much easier.

### Added
- Version 1.0.0 changes many thing
  - koop is now a module, installable via `npm install`
  - koop-server is no more; all central code is in the koop project
  - to use Koop you must use it as middleware in an app that boots up an http server
