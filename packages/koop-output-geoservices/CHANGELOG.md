### Fixed
* Only normalize error if it exists.

## [2.0.1] - 2020-10-15

## [1.5.0] - 2018-05-29
### Added

* Add route `rest/generateToken` and pass on to associated handler which in turn calls model's `authenticate` function

### Fixed

* Bumped featureserver dependency to 2.13.0

## [1.2.0] - 2018-04-27
